# Student's Academic Level Evaluation

#### -- Project Status: Active

## Project Intro/Objective
This is an educational data set which is collected from learning management system (LMS) called Kalboard 360. Kalboard 360 is a multi-agent LMS, which has been designed to facilitate learning through the use of leading-edge technology. Such system provides users with a synchronous access to educational resources from any device with Internet connection.

The data is collected using a learner activity tracker tool, which called experience API (xAPI). The xAPI is a component of the training and learning architecture (TLA) that enables to monitor learning progress and learnerâ€™s actions like reading an article or watching a training video. The experience API helps the learning activity providers to determine the learner, activity and objects that describe a learning experience. The dataset consists of 480 student records and 16 features. The features are classified into three major categories: (1) Demographic features such as gender and nationality. (2) Academic background features such as educational stage, grade Level and section. (3) Behavioral features such as raised hand on class, opening resources, answering survey by parents, and school satisfaction.

The dataset consists of 305 males and 175 females. The students come from different origins such as 179 students are from Kuwait, 172 students are from Jordan, 28 students from Palestine, 22 students are from Iraq, 17 students from Lebanon, 12 students from Tunis, 11 students from Saudi Arabia, 9 students from Egypt, 7 students from Syria, 6 students from USA, Iran and Libya, 4 students from Morocco and one student from Venezuela.

The dataset is collected through two educational semesters: 245 student records are collected during the first semester and 235 student records are collected during the second semester.

The data set includes also the school attendance feature such as the students are classified into two categories based on their absence days: 191 students exceed 7 absence days and 289 students their absence days under 7.

This dataset includes also a new category of features; this feature is parent parturition in the educational process. Parent participation feature have two sub features: Parent Answering Survey and Parent School Satisfaction. There are 270 of the parents answered survey and 210 are not, 292 of the parents are satisfied from the school and 188 are not.

The Objective of the project is to make use of the XAPI data to classify the student into different levels such as High ,Medium and Low.The dataset contains the column Class to indicate this.


### Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling

### Technologies
* Python(v3.7.0)
* Anaconda(v4.6.11)
* Jupyter(v5.2.4) 

For convenience it is suggested that you install Anaconda distribution for your respective OS.Anaconda comes with all the libraries preinstalled and all the major IDE and web applications.

## Project Description
The aim of this project is to determine the level of academic performance of the students using the data obtained from XAPI.The challenging part is that most of them are categorical data 

## Needs of this project

- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- statistical modeling
- Machine learning Algorithms

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).

2. After cloning, open the folder's directory using jupyter notebook,you should be able to open the project.ipynb inside it. 
    
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are available in jupyter notbook ipynb file

4. Different observations are made on the dataset and different ML models are used.

5. Also try to make use of the libraries you are familiar with and try to improve the model's prediction as much as possible.
